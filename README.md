# README

## Project Description
You are a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to plan road trips. This app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination.

Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture. The front-end will communicate with your back-end through an API. Your job is to expose that API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.

## Learning Goals
- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer


## Exposed API Endpoints
Getting started
  - fork and clone this repo to your local.
  - run `bundle install` in your terminal
  - run `rails db:{create,migrate}`
  - run `bundle exec figaro install` (this creates your application.yml file where you can store your API Keys)
  - You'll need to request an api key from the following services:
      - [Mapquest API Geocoding AND Directions](https://developer.mapquest.com/)
      - [Pexel Images API](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
      - [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Keep your api secret!
      - By adding your api key to your `application.yml` file you can limit exposing your keys!
        - `MAP_QUEST_KEY: <<YOUR KEY>>`
        - `OPEN_WEATHER_KEY: <<YOUR KEY>>`
        - `PEXEL_API: <<YOUR KEY>>`
